# Hack2019-Firebase
Backend portion of Hack Ohio Project 2019

Hackathon project to allow users to start Spotify sessions and allow others to vote on subsequent songs. 

Ex: you're at a party and you and your friends upvote Mr. Brightside, which becomes the #1 upvoted song and plays next.

## Overall design

Each session would have a host, which is playing a playlist this app adds and removes from.

## Completed work

A database was not implemented so all this does is call the Spotify API to get a playlist and adds tracks to it.
